        <h2>Personal Website</h2>
        <p>
            Having previously used wordpress.com, I decided over the summer to move my personal blog to its own website.
            <br><br> I host the site on an Ubuntu server with Google Cloud Services. In the process of building it, 
            I acquired some experience in full stack development, specifically the LAMP stack used in Wordpress sites.

            <b><s>Visit the site here</s></b>â†— 
                <br>
                (I am no longer hosting the site, as it turned unaffordable.
                <br> It will go up again when I earn more!)
